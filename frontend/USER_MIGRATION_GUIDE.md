# User Migration Guide

## Overview
This guide helps you migrate your existing 60-70 users from your old NextAuth + Supabase app to the new Clerk + Supabase app while preserving all their data.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Environment Setup
Add these environment variables to your `.env.local`:

```env
# New app (Clerk + Supabase)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_new_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_new_supabase_anon_key
NEW_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_new_supabase_service_key

# Old app (NextAuth + Supabase)
OLD_SUPABASE_URL=your_old_supabase_url
OLD_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_old_supabase_service_key

# Clerk
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install @clerk/nextjs
```

## Migration Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Old Database
1. **Export your old database schema** to understand the table structure
2. **Note the table names** for users, tasks, and user stats
3. **Update the migration script** with your actual table names

### Step 2: Run Database Migrations
1. Go to your **new Supabase dashboard**
2. Run the SQL migrations in order:
   - `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
   - `supabase/migrations/002_user_migrations.sql`

### Step 3: Update Migration Script
Edit `scripts/migrate-users.ts` and update these table names to match your old database:

```typescript
// Update these table names to match your old database
.from('users') // Your old users table name
.from('tasks') // Your old tasks table name  
.from('user_stats') // Your old user stats table name
```

### Step 4: Run the Migration
```bash
# Run the migration script
npx tsx scripts/migrate-users.ts
```

The script will:
- âœ… Create Clerk users for all existing users
- âœ… Migrate all their tasks to the new database
- âœ… Migrate all their user stats and preferences
- âœ… Track the migration for reference

### Step 5: Notify Your Users
Send an email to your users explaining:
