# User Sync Issue Analysis Report

## 🔍 Problem Summary

Your Clerk-Supabase sync system has multiple issues that are preventing proper user data cleanup when accounts are deleted:

### 1. **Orphaned Data in Database**
- **21 orphaned users** found in Supabase (users deleted from Clerk but data remains in database)
- **44 orphaned tasks** and **21 orphaned progress records**
- These users: `user_31KpxpEj58BKNYOY6JLvkZYYBWt`, `user_30MAw3XmqVKJg2vu7Q2`, etc.

### 2. **Invalid Service Role Key** ⚠️ 
- Your `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is returning "Invalid API key" error
- This prevents:
  - Webhook deletion operations from working
  - Daily reset system from creating user_progress records
  - Admin operations that require elevated permissions

### 3. **Webhook Issues**
- Clerk webhook is configured but failing due to service role key issue
- Next.js 15 compatibility issues (fixed in code)
- Webhook secret may need verification

## 🛠️ Immediate Actions Required

### Step 1: Fix Service Role Key
1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Navigate to**: Project Settings → API → Service Role Key
3. **Copy the service role key** (starts with `eyJ...`)
4. **Update your environment file**:
   ```bash
   # In .env.development or .env.local
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_new_service_role_key_here
   ```

### Step 2: Verify Webhook Configuration in Clerk
1. **Go to Clerk Dashboard**: https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. **Navigate to**: Webhooks → Configure endpoint
3. **Ensure webhook URL is set to**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/clerk`
4. **Verify events**: `user.created` and `user.deleted` are enabled
5. **Check webhook secret** matches your `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in env file

### Step 3: Clean Up Orphaned Data
After fixing the service role key, run:
```bash
npm run cleanup:orphaned
# OR
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/admin/cleanup-orphaned
```

## 🔧 What I Fixed

### ✅ Next.js 15 Compatibility
- Fixed `headers()` async requirement in webhook
- Updated webhook route to use `await headers()`

### ✅ Webhook Error Handling
- Enhanced error logging and recovery
- Added graceful fallback for missing user progress records

### ✅ Daily Reset Improvements
- Auto-creation of user progress records
- Reduced error spam with adaptive intervals

## 🧪 Test Your Fix

After updating the service role key:

1. **Test the connection**:
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/test-supabase-connection.ts
   ```

2. **Test webhook simulation**:
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/test-webhook-simulation.ts
   ```

3. **Clean up orphaned data**:
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/manual-cleanup.ts
   ```

## 🎯 Expected Results

After fixing these issues:
- ✅ New users will be properly synced between Clerk and Supabase
- ✅ When users delete accounts, all their data (tasks, progress, behavior tracking) will be automatically cleaned up
- ✅ Daily reset system will work without 404 errors
- ✅ No more orphaned data accumulation

## 📊 Current State

**Clerk Users**: 31 active users  
**Supabase Users**: 21 orphaned users (0 valid)  
**Sync Status**: ❌ Broken  
**Data Integrity**: ❌ Compromised
