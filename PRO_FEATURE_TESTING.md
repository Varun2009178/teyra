## Checking AI Request Logs

If you want to verify the daily limit manually or reset your usage:

### View Current Usage (via API):

```bash
# In browser console on dashboard:
const token = await (await fetch('/api/user/me')).json()
const response = await fetch('/api/extension/ai-limit', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` }
})
console.log(await response.json())
```

### Reset AI Request Count (Database):

If you need to test the limit from scratch:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Open the `ai_request_log` table
3. Delete all rows for your user_id
4. Refresh the extension - you should have 5/5 again

## Stripe Test Payments (Optional)

   - Use any future expiry date (e.g., 12/34)
   - Use any 3-digit CVC (e.g., 123)
   - Use any ZIP code (e.g., 12345)

4. After successful payment:
   - Stripe webhook will trigger

## Troubleshooting

### "I'm seeing 3/3 instead of 5/5"

1. Check the API route at `/api/extension/ai-limit/route.ts` - it should have `DAILY_LIMIT = 5`
2. Clear your browser cache and reload the extension
3. Check Supabase `ai_request_log` table - delete old entries

### "Toggle button doesn't appear"

- Make sure `NODE_ENV=development` in your environment
- Check the browser console for errors
- Verify you're running on `localhost:3000`

### "Pro features still locked after toggling"

1. Close and reopen the Account Status modal
2. Reload the extension (chrome://extensions/ ‚Üí reload)
3. Refresh the dashboard page
4. Check Supabase `user_progress` table - `is_pro` should be `true`

---

## Database Structure

For reference, here's what the database should have:

### `user_progress` table:
```sql
- user_id (text, primary key)
- is_pro (boolean) - FALSE for free, TRUE for pro
- stripe_customer_id (text) - Stripe customer ID
- stripe_subscription_id (text) - Stripe subscription ID
- pro_since (timestamptz) - When they became Pro
```

### `ai_request_log` table:
```sql
- id (bigint, primary key)
- user_id (text) - References user
- created_at (timestamptz) - When request was made
```
