## 📋 What You Need to Do Before Launch

### 1. **Run Database Migration** (2 minutes)
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_progress
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ai_schedule_uses INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

UPDATE user_progress
SET ai_schedule_uses = 0
WHERE ai_schedule_uses IS NULL;
```

### 2. **Update Environment Variables in Vercel** (10 minutes)

**CRITICAL - Must change to LIVE keys:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` → pk_live_xxx
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` → sk_live_xxx
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` → sk_live_xxx
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` → pk_live_xxx
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` → whsec_xxx (from Stripe webhook setup)
- `STRIPE_PRICE_ID` → price_xxx (from Stripe product)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` → https://yourdomain.com

### 3. **Configure Clerk for Production** (5 minutes)
- Switch to production app
- Remove development email restrictions
- Add production redirect URLs

### 4. **Configure Stripe for Production** (5 minutes)
- Switch to Live Mode
- Create "Teyra Pro" product at $10/month
- Set up webhook endpoint
- Copy webhook secret

### 5. **Test Before Announcing** (15 minutes)
- Sign up with new email
- Create tasks
- Try AI scheduling (3 times → upgrade modal)
- Test payment with test card
- Check calendar on mobile
- Verify daily reset works

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Development vs Production
- **Development**: Only specific emails can sign up (Clerk limitation)
- **Production**: ALL emails work once you configure Clerk properly

### Mobile Calendar
- Optimized for desktop (drag & drop works best)
- Mobile warning popup informs users
- Still functional on mobile, just not ideal

### AI Scheduling
- Requires valid Groq API key
- Limited to 3 free uses per user (by design)
- Needs timezone from client browser

---

## 🎯 Post-Launch Monitoring

### Week 1 Checklist:
- [ ] Monitor Vercel Analytics for errors
- [ ] Check Stripe Dashboard for successful payments
- [ ] Verify daily reset cron is running
- [ ] Watch Groq API usage (costs)
- [ ] Check Supabase database size
- [ ] Monitor Clerk authentication success rate

### What to Watch:
- **High AI scheduling usage** → Might need to increase Groq API limits
- **Failed payments** → Check Stripe webhook logs
- **Database growth** → May need to archive old tasks
- **High error rates** → Check Vercel logs

---

## 💰 Expected Costs (Monthly)

- **Vercel**: $0 (Hobby plan) or $20/month (Pro)
- **Supabase**: $0 (Free tier) - covers ~50K users
- **Clerk**: $0 (Free tier) - covers 5K MAU
- **Stripe**: 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction
- **Groq API**: ~$0.10 per 1K requests (very cheap)

**Total**: ~$0-20/month + transaction fees
